## Background

> Sunlight is the best disinfectant.

> -- [William O. Douglas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_O._Douglas)

Companies struggle to keep everyone on the same page. People are hyper-connected in the moment but still don’t know what’s happening across the company. Employees and investors, co-founders and execs, customers and community, they all want more transparency. The solution is surprisingly simple and effective - great company updates that build transparency and alignment.

With that in mind we designed the [Carrot](https://carrot.io/) software-as-a-service application, powered by the open source [OpenCompany platform](https://github.com/open-company). The product design is based on three principles:

1. It has to be easy or no one will play.
2. The "big picture" should always be visible.
3. Alignment is valuable beyond the team, too.

Carrot simplifies how key business information is shared with stakeholders to create alignment. When information about growth, finances, ownership and challenges is shared transparently, it inspires trust, new ideas and new levels of stakeholder engagement. Carrot makes it easy for founders to engage with employees and investors, creating alignment for everyone.

[Carrot](https://carrot.io/) is GitHub for the rest of your company.

Transparency expectations are changing. Organizations need to change as well if they are going to attract and retain savvy employees and investors. Just as open source changed the way we build software, transparency changes how we build successful companies with information that is open, interactive, and always accessible. Carrot turns transparency into a competitive advantage.

## Overview

The OpenCompany Proxy Service handles proxying chart requests from the Web client to Google Sheets. This is needed
to extract and format the chart from the HTML response and to deal with
[CORs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) restrictions.


## Local Setup

Prospective users of [Carrot](https://carrot.io/) should get started by going to [Carrot.io](https://carrot.io/). The following local setup is **for developers** wanting to work on the OpenCompany Proxy Service.

Most of the dependencies are internal, meaning [Leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen) will handle getting them for you. There are a few exceptions:

* [Java 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) - a Java 8 JRE is needed to run Clojure
* [Leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen) 2.5.1+ - Clojure's build and dependency management tool

#### Java

Chances are your system already has Java 8+ installed. You can verify this with:

```console
java -version
```

If you do not have Java 8+ [download it](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) and follow the installation instructions.

#### Leiningen

Leiningen is easy to install:

1. Download the latest [lein script from the stable branch](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technomancy/leiningen/stable/bin/lein).
1. Place it somewhere that's on your $PATH (`env | grep PATH`). `/usr/local/bin` is a good choice if it is on your PATH.
1. Set it to be executable. `chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/lein`
1. Run it: `lein` This will finish the installation.

Then let Leiningen install the rest of the dependencies:

```console
git clone https://github.com/open-company/open-company-proxy.git
cd open-company-proxy
lein deps
```

## Usage

Run the proxy with: `lein start`

Or start a REPL with: `lein repl`


## Testing

Tests are run in continuous integration of the `master` and `mainline` branches on [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/open-company/open-company-proxy):

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/open-company/open-company-proxy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/open-company/open-company-proxy)

To run the tests locally:

lein kibit
lean eastwood
```
